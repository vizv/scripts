    :summary: Fort journal with a multi-line text editor.
    :tags: fort interface

The `gui/journal` interface makes it easy to take notes and document
important details for the fortresses.

With this multi-line text editor,
you can keep track of your fortress's background story, goals, notable events,
and both short-term and long-term plans.

This is particularly useful when you need to take a longer break from the game.
Having detailed notes makes it much easier to resume your game after
a few weekds or months, without losing track of your progress and objectives.
