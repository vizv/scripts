    :summary: Allows you to embark as any civilisation, including dead and non-dwarven ones.
    :tags: embark armok

This script must be run on the embark screen when choosing an origin civilization.
When run, you can add any civilization, including dead or non-dwarven civilizations,
to the list of choices.


Usage
-----

::

    embark-anyone

Note
-----
Non-dwarven civs have their own mechanics which can render fortress mode difficult
or unplayable. Preparing carefully is advised, and some crucial items may need to be
spawned in with other DFHack tools (e.g. `gui/create-item`).
